stable: True
public: True
include:
  - types.yaml
definitions:

 - GnssSignal:
    short_desc: Represents all the relevant information about the signal
    desc: |
        Signal identifier containing constellation, band, and satellite identifier
    fields:
        - sat:
            type: u16
            desc: Constellation-specific satellite identifier
        - code:
            type: u8
            desc: Signal constellation, band and code
        - reserved:
            type: u8
            desc: Reserved

 - ObsGPSTime:
    short_desc: Millisecond-accurate GPS time
    desc: |
      A wire-appropriate GPS time, defined as the number of
      milliseconds since beginning of the week on the Saturday/Sunday
      transition.
    fields:
        - tow:
            type: u32
            units: ms
            desc: Milliseconds since start of GPS week
        - wn:
            type: u16
            units: week
            desc: GPS week number

 - CarrierPhase:
    short_desc: GPS carrier phase measurement.
    desc: |
      Carrier phase measurement in cycles represented as a 40-bit
      fixed point number with Q32.8 layout, i.e. 32-bits of whole
      cycles and 8-bits of fractional cycles.  This phase has the
      same sign as the pseudorange.
    fields:
        - i:
            type: s32
            units: cycles
            desc: Carrier phase whole cycles
        - f:
            type: u8
            units: cycles / 256
            desc: Carrier phase fractional part
