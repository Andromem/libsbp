package: swiftnav.sbp.bootload
description: |
  Messages for the bootloading configuration on the device.

  These are in the implementation-defined range (0x0000-0x00FF), and
  are intended for internal use only. Note that some of these messages
  share the same message type ID for both the host request and the
  device response.
stable: False
public: True
include:
  - types.yaml
definitions:

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_HANDSHAKE:
    id: 0x00B0
    public: True
    short_desc: Bootloading handshake (host <=> device)
    desc: |
      The handshake message establishes a handshake between the device
      bootloader and the host.  The payload string contains the
      bootloader version number, but returns an empty string for
      earlier versions.
    fields:
      - handshake:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          desc: Version number string (not NULL terminated)

 - MSG_BOOTLOADER_JUMP_TO_APP:
    id: 0x00B1
    public: False
    short_desc: Bootloader jump to application (host => device)
    desc: |
      The host initiates the bootloader to jump to the application.
    fields:
      - jump:
          type: u8
          desc: Ignored by the device

 - MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA:
    id: 0x00DD
    public: True
    short_desc: Read FPGA device ID over UART (host <=> device)
    desc: |
      The device message from the host reads a unique device
      identifier from the SwiftNAP, an FPGA. The host requests the ID
      by sending a MSG_NAP_DEVICE_DNA with an empty payload. The
      device responds with the same message with the device ID in the
      payload. Note that this ID is tied to the FPGA, and not related
      to the Piksi's serial number.
    fields:
      - dna:
          type: array
          fill: u8
          size: 8
          desc: |
            57-bit SwiftNAP FPGA Device ID. Remaining bits are padded
            on the right.
