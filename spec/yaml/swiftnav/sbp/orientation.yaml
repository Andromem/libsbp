 - MSG_BASELINE_HEADING:
    id: 0x020F
    short_desc: Heading relative to True North
    desc: |
      This message reports the baseline heading pointing from the base station
      to the rover relative to True North. The full GPS time is given by the
      preceding MSG_GPS_TIME with the matching time-of-week (tow). It is intended
      that time-matched RTK mode is used when the base station is moving.
