stable: False
include:
  - types.yaml
  - lib.yaml
definitions:

 - ObsGPSTime:
    desc: |
      A wire-appropriate GPS time, defined as the number of
      milliseconds since beginning of the week on the Saturday/Sunday
      transition.
    fields:
        - tow:
            type: u32
            units: ms
            desc: Milliseconds since start of GPS week
        - wn:
            type: u16
            units: week
            desc: GPS week number

 - ObservationHeader:
    desc: Header of a GPS observation message
    fields:
        - t:
            type: ObsGPSTime
            desc: GPS time of this observation.
        - n_obs:
            type: u8
            desc: |
              Total number of observations. First nibble is the size
              of the sequence (n), second nibble is the zero-indexed
              counter (ith packet of n)

 - PackedObsContent:
    desc: GPS observations for a particular satellite signal.
    fields:
        - P:
            type: u32
            units: cm
            desc: Pseudorange observation.
        - L:
            type: CarrierPhase
            desc: Carrier phase observation.
        - cn0:
            type: u8
            units: dB Hz
            desc: Carrier-to-Noise density
        - lock:
            type: u16
            desc: |
              Lock indicator. This value changes whenever a satellite
              signal has lost and regained lock, indicating that the
              carrier phase ambiguity may have changed. There is no
              significance to the value of the lock indicator.
        - prn:
            type: u8
            desc: PRN identifier of the satellite signal

 - MSG_OBS:
    id: 0x0045

    fields:
        - header:
            type: ObservationHeader

        - obs:
            type: array
            fill: PackedObsContent
            map_by: prn
            desc: Observations

 - MSG_BASE_POS:
    id: 0x0044
    short_desc: MSG_BASE_POS
    fields:
        - lat:
            type: double
            units: deg
            desc: Latitude
